    <img src="images-w1/ahmed-zoweil-pic1.jpg" alt="Ahmed Zouweil picture" style="width: 155px; height: 210px;">
    <h4 align="justify">Ahmed Hassan Zewail (Arabic: أحمد حسن زويل‎) was an Egyptian-American scientist, known as the 
            "father of femtochemistry". He was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on 
            femtochemistry and became the first Egyptian to win a Nobel Prize in a scientific field. He was 
            the Linus Pauling Chair Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Physics, and the director of the 
            Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.
            Femtochemistry is the area of physical chemistry that studies chemical reactions on extremely 
            short timescales (approximately 10−15 seconds or one femtosecond, hence the name) in order to 
            study the very act of atoms within molecules (reactants) rearranging themselves to form new 
            molecules (products). In 1999, Ahmed Hassan Zewail received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 
            his pioneering work in this field showing that it is possible to see how atoms in a molecule 
            move during a chemical reaction with flashes of laser light.</h4>
